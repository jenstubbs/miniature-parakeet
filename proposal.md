# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The game snake, it will allow players to chose difficulty as well as there icon

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My software will take user input and execute their choices.  It will allow users to select their difficulty, chose their own icon, as well as reflect a final score.  It will run the actual game that will allow the user to control the snake and keep track of points.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None 
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A running program that will allow users to run an actual game of snake.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game runs and user input works, but it may no always take the user input or project final scores.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be allowing user input and fully executing it.  It will show a game that runs with user commands and gives a final score.  It would allow users to choose a level of difficulty as well as their own icon.  

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to use pygames.  As well as displaying the game and allowing a user to use their arrow keys to control the snake.  As well as learning to use different colors and icons.  I will need to learn a lot about running games on python rather than the basics.
